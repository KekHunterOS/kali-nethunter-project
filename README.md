![Kali NetHunter](https://gitlab.com/kalilinux/nethunter/build-scripts/kali-nethunter-project/raw/master/images/nethunter-git-logo.png)
## A project by Offensive Security
**The Kali NetHunter** is an Android penetration testing platform targeted towards Nexus and OnePlus devices built on top of Kali Linux, which includes some special and unique features. 
Of course, you have all the usual Kali tools in NetHunter as well as the ability to get a full VNC session from your phone to a graphical Kali chroot, however the strength of NetHunter does not end there. 
We've incorporated some amazing features into the NetHunter OS which are both powerful and unique. From pre-programmed HID Keyboard (Teensy) attacks, to BadUSB Man In The Middle attacks, to one-click MANA Evil Access Point setups, access to the Offensive Security Exploit Database... 
And yes, NetHunter natively supports wireless 802.11 frame injection with a variety of supported USB NICs.

## Is Kali NetHunter an Android ROM?

Kali Linux NetHunter is **not** a ROM but is meant to be installed over an existing stock/factory image of Android. It can also be installed over some Cyanogenmod based ROMs depending on device support. It is heavily based on using custom kernels and only supports a select number of devices.
We're relying on you, the community, to port your devices for the full Kali NetHunter experience.
